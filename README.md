### Final Project

For the final project we were to identify an industry problem, iterate on potential solutions, find a potential use case, and then create a targeted business proposal. The proposal then needed to be formatted as **two** presentations: 
* One targetted towards business leadership such as a CEO, General Manager, etc  
* The other targetted towards technical leadership such as CIO, CTO, etc
  
**Online Presentation** is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt87aZaxtJc)  
  
### UAV Drone Ambulance Pilot Program for L.A. County   
I portray the CDO & CTO of a fictitious technology consultancy T&O Dynamics. Our solution is to leverage UAVs to assist with emergency response in the Greater Los Angeles area. Additionally, this also would require a back-end data platform, which also offered secondary benefits as will be mentioned in the presentation.
  
**Audience**  
*NOTE: I did extensive research to at least have a reasonable speculation as to who my audience MIGHT have been if this were a real consulting engagement. Obviously in "real" life I would have had an Account Manager to help with this. Also please realize that government projects typically have more organizational complexity and thus for the targetted audience I felt it was best to include **two** different government organizations:*  
  
* LA County Health Services
  * Business Lead: Hal F. Yee, MD/PhD - Chief Deputy Director, Clinical Affairs
  * Business Lead: Nina J. Park, MD - Chief Deputy Director, Population Health
  * Technical Lead: Kevin Lynch - Chief Information Officer
* LA County Office of the CIO
  * Business Lead: Dave Wesolik - Office of the CIO: General Manager ITS
  * Technical Lead: Bill Kehoe - Chief Information Officer 
   
As part of this I researched initiatives, goals, and overall strategy for both of these organizations, and *hopefully* show how they align to existing iniatives. Modesty aside, this extensive research into the customer organizations was one of *two* factors that differentiated my proposal from other students' prior presentations. I mention this because I work in a consulting organizations as part of my current dayjob, and that background info on BOTH your customer organzation AND their industry is critical to a successful consulting engagement.   
   
**Goal**  
To deliver a functioning prototype at 270 days  
* Milestone 1: Initial air test of Medevac UAV Drone at 120 days
* Milestone 2: Alpha release at 150 days
* Milestone 3: Initial field test of patient scenarios at 180 days

*NOTE: I made this timeline deliberately aggressive. Again in "real" life I can certainly see it taking twice this long. However, this is a learning exercise and I wanted to see how I would be graded by proposing a more aggressive timeline as the incentive for requesting more money. The idea being we maximize parallel development and engineering, thus the development of the Drone OS and machine learning models that drive its auto-pilot feature set is NOT impeded by the aerospace and mechanical engineering. Same with process development with the medical operators or compliance validation with Legal. And certainly for a government project, the secondary benefit of creating several dozen high-paid jobs with high potential for career development is an opportunity to garner public approval.*

NOTE:This was partner project with another student, Daniel Turner. For my part, I tackled the presentation tackling technical leadership. My partner's presentation is also available online [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9AugYGXR1w)
